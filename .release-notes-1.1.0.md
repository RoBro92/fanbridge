# FanBridge v1.1.0


Highlights
- Modularized codebase for maintainability: extracted core logging/metrics, services for disks/serial, and API blueprints.
- Added app factory (`create_app`) while retaining `app:app` for Gunicorn compatibility.
- Production “sim” mode removed (local dev only). Container still runs without Unraid mounts and without a serial device.
- Sensible defaults in Docker: preferred serial port defaults to `/dev/ttyACM0` (RP2040). Missing device no longer blocks startup; an error is logged and surfaced in the UI.

API & Backend
- New blueprints: `/api/serial/*`, `/api/app/version`, `/api/metrics`, `/api/logs*` organized by responsibility.
- Logs API refactored to use a ring buffer handler in `core.logging_setup`.
- Version and release checks moved to `core.appver` with a minimal HTTP helper.
- Metrics implemented in `core.metrics` and exposed at `/api/metrics` (Prometheus text).

Templates & Docs
- Unraid template clarifies serial device field is intentionally left blank by default; recommended device is `/dev/ttyACM0` (RP2040). Preferred port env defaults to `/dev/ttyACM0`.
- README simplified for production with a clear project overview and a concise project structure outline.

Container & Build
- Removed unused `smartmontools` from the image to keep it lean.
- Comments and hints tightened for production clarity.
